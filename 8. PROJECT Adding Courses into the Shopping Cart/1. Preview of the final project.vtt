00:00.370 --> 00:07.690
So this review the scope for the shopping cart and the soon to be the feeder sprawly.

00:07.920 --> 00:14.200
The user can have courses into the shopping cart is going to be one of the features of this project.

00:14.400 --> 00:23.250
And so the user can remove courses from the shopping cart so the shopping cart content is going to be

00:23.250 --> 00:25.500
set into local storage.

00:25.620 --> 00:33.390
This is going to be really nice because saving these in the local storage the user can and reload the

00:33.390 --> 00:41.450
page and everything is going to be there because you save into the storage the shopping cart is going

00:41.450 --> 00:45.830
to this plate and the contents from the local storage.

00:45.900 --> 00:55.190
When the page loads and finally when a person is removed from the shopping cart it's going to be removed

00:55.290 --> 00:58.490
also from local storage.

00:58.510 --> 00:59.620
So let's review the project.

00:59.620 --> 01:03.410
This is going to be the interface for this project you can see we have some courses right here what

01:03.410 --> 01:03.940
are going on.

01:03.940 --> 01:09.090
For example I'm going to select these Istomin five CSSA three javascript for beginners.

01:09.130 --> 01:12.960
When I click here not to cut and I'm going to select this one.

01:12.980 --> 01:14.840
So you your guitar for beginners.

01:14.850 --> 01:20.430
When I select two chords into the shopping cart then the shopping cart and when I go to a dock and here

01:20.480 --> 01:24.290
you can see that we have these two courses in two they got up.

01:24.620 --> 01:31.390
So I'm going to show you know these and these courses are going to be saved into little kind of storage.

01:31.400 --> 01:38.420
So once they use their guns back to the website and opens they got the elements are going to be here

01:38.960 --> 01:43.310
and they use it is going to be able to remove one of these so you can remove these.

01:43.310 --> 01:49.330
And again relo and you can see that we have these in their local authorities so we can have an alert

01:49.350 --> 01:50.100
of course.

01:50.960 --> 01:56.800
And you can see we have another recourse sort of law again and you can see that we have the courses

01:57.310 --> 01:59.090
saved into this storage.

01:59.110 --> 02:01.500
So this is really nice.

02:01.720 --> 02:09.130
This is going to be the first break of this course and with this break you're going to learn the basics

02:09.460 --> 02:12.900
of scriptum and also look at storage.
