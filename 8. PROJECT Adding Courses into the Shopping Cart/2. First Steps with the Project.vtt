00:00.300 --> 00:05.250
In the course materials for this chapter you will find the shopping cart for them sort of going up and

00:05.250 --> 00:14.020
these into response to your code up in the index and right click to open these with live settlement.

00:15.670 --> 00:24.210
Open again and this is going to be the same you that we really work in the previous videos.

00:24.300 --> 00:32.080
You make one and the only difference is that in the shopping cart it doesn't have anything of this chapter

00:32.080 --> 00:37.590
is that everytime you click on the card is going to be at the items right here.

00:37.930 --> 00:45.550
But also something really important is that we're going to save the courses into the local storage.

00:45.580 --> 00:49.300
This is going to be the best example of domus scripting.

00:49.310 --> 00:56.230
Also look at the storage than the previous one but we're going to continue practicing everything that

00:56.260 --> 00:58.160
we learn in the fundamentals.

00:58.980 --> 01:05.190
So again we're going to create the sections here we're going to create the variables in the top then

01:05.190 --> 01:07.070
we're going to create some listeners.

01:07.320 --> 01:11.190
And finally we're going to create the fortunes.

01:11.220 --> 01:14.550
So in this case we're going to need three different variables.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.860
We're going to need one for the shopping cart.

01:17.190 --> 01:24.580
We're going to need another one with this list of courses and so other one to please this God.

01:24.960 --> 01:30.840
So I started with the section for example if we opened the index if you scroll a little you can see

01:30.840 --> 01:32.600
the other we have these courses list.

01:32.610 --> 01:35.850
This is they grapple with all the courses.

01:36.060 --> 01:41.750
So we're going to create a variable right here because we're going to call these 1 courses.

01:42.160 --> 01:48.820
It's going to be called to document de-select selector and we're going to pass Zaidee is going to be

01:48.870 --> 01:53.230
courses least then we're going to create different listeners.

01:53.230 --> 01:58.840
So we're going to call this one and love them and listeners of course remember you can name these wherever

01:58.840 --> 02:00.820
you want.

02:00.980 --> 02:05.370
Then we need to create this function so loaded with listeners.

02:06.370 --> 02:09.910
And here we're going to have our live listeners for this break.

02:10.370 --> 02:19.270
So first we're going to win a new course is it is going to be like courses Dopp.

02:19.360 --> 02:26.850
Well listen here's what I use allegation against Gleick and it's going to run a Fortune called by Gore's

02:28.150 --> 02:29.980
when need to create dysfunction.

02:30.350 --> 02:35.730
So we're going to have these functions on the bottom and in order to use the Legation to remember that

02:35.730 --> 02:40.280
you have to pass day event.

02:40.310 --> 02:45.960
So what's going on here is cancel that luck and where they're going to have of course added something

02:46.080 --> 02:51.770
like Yeah just to make sure that everything is working before we continue the content.

02:51.980 --> 03:00.050
So we're going up and so scroll click here and you can see of course that it saw the variables and working

03:00.140 --> 03:02.090
just fine in the Fanchon's.

03:02.090 --> 03:09.700
So I'm going to remove these get are going to either Komen Race you know let's use the Legation use

03:10.570 --> 03:17.720
delegation to find the Course that was added into the shopping cart.

03:18.050 --> 03:24.760
So once again to use the if the target and remember that you're going to send these riders to the console

03:25.280 --> 03:31.690
each dot dot and yet you just need to come in line in order to see it is working.

03:32.090 --> 03:37.370
And click here and you can see that this is going to print the element that was Cliq.

03:37.370 --> 03:44.390
So we're going to start it and you can see that we have the class of the car right here.

03:44.390 --> 03:56.060
So we're going to use either to get that class list that contains what are going to use to go to so

03:56.070 --> 04:03.900
we're going to have a console that loff added something like this something simple to test that everything

04:03.900 --> 04:04.970
is working.

04:05.460 --> 04:12.530
So save these and click on that two cars and you can see we have added We want to remove these for example

04:13.160 --> 04:20.370
and you can see here and you can have Remember that are default because this is going to be the standard

04:20.370 --> 04:27.210
behavior in the browser when you have a link and you click it will try to open the link and you can

04:27.210 --> 04:33.650
see if we that prevent default we prevent that jump that we saw in just a little.

04:33.870 --> 04:36.930
So we're going to make something else before we finish this video.

04:36.940 --> 04:44.630
Want to go out and read the Course by news so you can see that we have contents at the.

04:44.670 --> 04:48.410
And this is going to bring in button that we have here.

04:48.720 --> 04:55.910
So I went to read this body was sort of going to use that element and to read everything from the card

04:56.520 --> 05:04.380
or when I use that log dot dot dot dot binding element by element.

05:04.560 --> 05:10.730
So what I'm going to make that we're arresting like this here and then you can see we have the cart

05:11.340 --> 05:14.570
so from here we can have access for example to these decks.

05:14.610 --> 05:16.970
They are out for the price.

05:16.980 --> 05:21.760
And if you take a look here we also have this data dash I-V.

05:21.870 --> 05:25.320
So each of these courses Cassadee for an ID.

05:25.560 --> 05:28.380
So using these We're going to have access to everything.

05:28.410 --> 05:35.950
And so the match that's going to be important I'm going to cut these good these and we're going to create

05:35.980 --> 05:39.180
any wearable coils gold and guns.

05:39.200 --> 05:44.600
Coats equals to this value and then we're going to read the bodies.

05:44.800 --> 05:49.810
So what are going to create an information that is going to we can get calls for.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.710
And what are going up as these calls information.

05:53.790 --> 05:57.170
So we need to copy these function.

05:57.560 --> 06:04.970
And what are going to create a new command that says Rietz the information of the select that selected

06:04.990 --> 06:13.970
course then we had this one function get calls and this is going to take of course as a parameter and

06:13.970 --> 06:17.700
then we can have guns or that lock goes like this.

06:19.180 --> 06:25.150
And just to make that test that everything is working I'm going to say these up in the console click

06:25.150 --> 06:26.980
here and you can see we have this card.

06:27.250 --> 06:27.960
Click here.

06:28.330 --> 06:30.810
And then you can see we have that card.

06:31.230 --> 06:39.270
This delegation is working in the next video sister working with this function to extract the estimate

06:39.850 --> 06:42.520
from the course that was selected.
