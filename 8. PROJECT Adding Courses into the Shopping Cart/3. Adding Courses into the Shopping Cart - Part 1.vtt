WEBVTT

00:00.660 --> 00:07.010
So we have this function get the Course in for we're passing discours which is the complete God.

00:07.530 --> 00:09.260
We're going to make some money.

00:09.330 --> 00:14.850
We're going to write a code that is going to extract decode information.

00:15.000 --> 00:22.450
So we're going to remove these and remove these and here's what I've got I create an object word and

00:22.460 --> 00:28.410
I create an object with the Course data.

00:28.490 --> 00:32.020
So it's going to be like this concert goers.

00:32.460 --> 00:35.070
And it's going to be equals to the obvious.

00:35.120 --> 00:38.650
Remember the object and the array they have difference.

00:38.670 --> 00:46.540
But one of these is that the object will have these reraises and so will have these properties.

00:46.550 --> 00:48.590
So what's going on out you match.

00:49.010 --> 00:51.870
The match is going to be equal to the course.

00:52.190 --> 00:55.440
Remember we're passing the complete card.

00:55.970 --> 00:59.310
So that's going to be available in the world.

00:59.440 --> 01:05.450
The content is going to be available and we can use the selector selector.

01:05.480 --> 01:14.980
We cannot for example AMG and I mean the path to the match so we can see then where the comma in the

01:14.990 --> 01:17.350
title of the course are going of course.

01:17.360 --> 01:26.480
Again the selector Angua are going to see for example fears so Bindi's and you can see the title of

01:26.480 --> 01:34.420
the Course is using it for sort of an average for Gomory rehearing what we're going to have the price.

01:34.430 --> 01:36.840
Price is equal of course.

01:37.030 --> 01:41.020
What is the electoral gain and the prize that we are in the rest.

01:41.020 --> 01:51.100
Is this when you say this ban so we're going to the selector last prize and it's so this ban.

01:51.310 --> 01:56.460
We need to out that OxyContin here and therefore we also need to.

01:56.490 --> 02:02.550
It can't be fixed content and thoughts and things like this.

02:02.630 --> 02:04.990
We need only the data.

02:05.300 --> 02:13.250
And the other way we were going to extract also the task and finally went through out there a the if

02:13.250 --> 02:19.240
you take a look here on the anchor we have these three that is called data the so we're going to have

02:19.400 --> 02:21.630
the it's going to be cost of course.

02:21.760 --> 02:26.050
I thought the selector we were going to select the anchor.

02:26.320 --> 02:34.120
Dang where going to get the attribute get attribute incident to the data that ID.

02:34.160 --> 02:38.550
So then we can send this to the console just to check.

02:38.710 --> 02:47.670
Or of course 18:4 save these including one of these and you can see we have the or you can see we have

02:47.710 --> 02:54.620
the ID Number two we had to have the match the price and the title is this cooking course.

02:54.620 --> 02:56.430
So the idea is looking nice.

02:57.230 --> 03:05.340
So now that we have this week I'm going to call another function insert into the shopping cart.

03:06.530 --> 03:08.730
And this is going to be called into.

03:08.810 --> 03:10.440
Got it.

03:10.630 --> 03:12.330
We're going to pass this up.

03:13.530 --> 03:16.280
So we need to write this function.

03:16.320 --> 03:22.460
This is going to display this elective course into the shopping cart.

03:23.700 --> 03:27.300
So we need to write this function function.

03:27.460 --> 03:33.580
And this is going to take a course also so and this object is going to be passed into this function

03:34.170 --> 03:35.240
as well.

03:35.920 --> 03:44.890
And then we're going to create our if you take a look on the index and scroll to the top what we're

03:44.890 --> 03:47.240
looking for this shopping cart.

03:47.420 --> 03:49.230
This is the.

03:49.280 --> 03:53.570
It contains this table and we have this table body at the moment.

03:53.570 --> 03:58.560
This is empty but we're going to insert the is the courses right here.

03:59.060 --> 04:06.900
And we need to use the word row for each of the courses that we're going to out into the shopping cart.

04:07.270 --> 04:13.530
What happened at the concert it's going to be cornstalk role in the center of this a little.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.920
Then this is going to be equal to document.

04:16.070 --> 04:22.050
And we're going to use again create element what we're going to create a table row and then we're going

04:22.050 --> 04:28.570
to be a template from the course of a week that we pass into the function.

04:28.580 --> 04:35.240
So what we're going to use grow that what we're going to use in addition to man this is going to bring

04:35.240 --> 04:42.960
in the mail from this template a string or template literal some ladies remember to use the back tip

04:43.950 --> 04:48.480
and single quotes doesn't work with them literals.
