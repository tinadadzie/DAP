WEBVTT

00:00.270 --> 00:05.730
So right here we come there is structure that we need in this case we need that they will throw it out

00:05.740 --> 00:13.220
so they close the road and then we need the table data and we're going to add for example the image

00:13.280 --> 00:14.790
the title and the price.

00:15.030 --> 00:22.500
And so we're going to have to remove the scores from the shopping cart or going out at the close of

00:22.500 --> 00:23.610
the T.

00:23.640 --> 00:31.810
And Rachel I'm going to hit me as RC and then when I close the doc then I'm going up in the lab sign

00:32.200 --> 00:33.420
up in the braces.

00:33.450 --> 00:39.070
And right here you can see we have code so I'm going to pass cores because we have this all into this

00:39.250 --> 00:45.990
shouldn't we pass the court's Imphal object into this function and we need to access this.

00:46.110 --> 00:48.450
We're going out that much.

00:48.450 --> 00:54.590
Remember that your axes are not weak in their properties using adult.

00:54.720 --> 01:04.540
So we're going to have another DD enclose that DD right here and then copies of copies in page right

01:04.540 --> 01:05.070
here.

01:06.520 --> 01:11.550
And this is going to be the title of course title like this.

01:11.560 --> 01:13.710
Now we're going to make two more copies of this

01:17.310 --> 01:20.710
the other one is going to be the price we're going up price right here.

01:21.300 --> 01:24.490
And the last one is going to be an anchor.

01:24.660 --> 01:26.890
So I'm going I can make some Aspasia here.

01:27.890 --> 01:34.460
And we're going to use a each ref is going to be to that punch saying we're going to create a class

01:34.460 --> 01:39.110
called remove and we're going to have that Ivy.

01:39.450 --> 01:46.720
This case is going to be equal to course and you can see the properties called Ivy.

01:46.850 --> 01:51.570
So we're going to be and this is going to be a next.

01:51.800 --> 01:57.680
Then we close the Ingur and this is going to close the table data.

01:58.220 --> 02:05.030
So they have this template is it's going to be added into these card content break into it they will

02:05.030 --> 02:05.910
bully.

02:05.930 --> 02:12.990
So we need to create that variable it's opened up that geas scroll to the top so I can my Here comma

02:14.020 --> 02:16.380
and we're going to call this one shopping.

02:16.430 --> 02:26.170
Got that content that is going to be to document that the selector and the avi it's going to be these

02:26.320 --> 02:27.750
card content.

02:28.180 --> 02:32.000
So we use the bonsai and got Gunton

02:34.630 --> 02:36.630
you and card content.

02:36.640 --> 02:40.550
And then this table while the keyboard.

02:41.280 --> 02:46.740
So now this variable is going to be available in the program and we can insert scroll to the bottom

02:47.430 --> 02:50.940
we can insert these grow into that.

02:50.940 --> 02:56.440
They will watch the so they're comin out into the shopping cart.

02:58.040 --> 03:05.570
And we're going to have shopping cart content Daut up in child and we're going to pass up all so save

03:05.570 --> 03:14.010
these and that's another one and that's of course for us for example this one is Timofei CSSA 3 and

03:14.010 --> 03:15.370
Javascript for beginners.

03:15.540 --> 03:22.860
You don't have to go out and then scroll to the top and you can see that we have the course information

03:23.550 --> 03:25.360
we have the magic we have the title.

03:25.800 --> 03:32.600
And that's all we have the the prize and this extra remove this from the from the list.

03:32.780 --> 03:40.270
If these you can see that we lost everything because we come in say these into a local storage.

03:40.470 --> 03:41.900
But this was working.

03:42.330 --> 03:45.570
If they are one of these you can see that the matches really big.

03:45.570 --> 03:47.210
So we're going to break it.

03:47.220 --> 03:52.100
I'm going to have an attribute with something like 100 pixels.

03:52.140 --> 03:53.670
I think it's going to be fine.

03:53.820 --> 03:55.330
So let's add another one.

03:56.450 --> 03:59.180
And yeah you can see that this looks way better.

03:59.510 --> 04:03.020
The machine really is Moul the name of the course the price.

04:03.140 --> 04:08.070
And we also have these X remove the cards from the shopping cart.

04:08.390 --> 04:14.240
So in the next video let's see how we can out the functionality to remove the car the courses from the

04:14.240 --> 04:14.930
shopping cart.
