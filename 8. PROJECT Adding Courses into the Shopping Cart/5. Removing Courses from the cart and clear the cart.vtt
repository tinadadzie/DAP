WEBVTT

00:00.690 --> 00:05.310
So we added the functionality to add elements into the cart.

00:05.640 --> 00:12.680
Let's see how we can make this Wootten functional in order to kill and remove elements from the car

00:12.700 --> 00:17.610
that you consider here on the top of the shopping cart of content.

00:17.650 --> 00:18.670
We're going to use these.

00:18.690 --> 00:27.600
We're going to play some delegation in order to add something like that when the Rev move on is click

00:27.900 --> 00:28.410
when I'm going.

00:28.470 --> 00:32.730
And this is going to be shopping cart Gunton at the end least.

00:32.760 --> 00:35.340
And this is going to react for a click.

00:35.370 --> 00:38.720
This one is going to be called the remote goes.

00:38.840 --> 00:47.470
So what do the companies that are going to take these to the bone and remove cars from the.

00:47.590 --> 00:54.810
I don't have the fun show I more cars and remember in order to work with the location you need to pass

00:55.470 --> 00:57.890
day event this way.

00:57.890 --> 01:06.380
We're going to have access to that target so same as we did before we're going to have enough thought

01:06.640 --> 01:07.250
to get.

01:07.670 --> 01:10.290
And you can see for example.

01:11.030 --> 01:11.760
Yeah.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.770
I'm going on a I'm going to check the source code the rescue.

01:17.280 --> 01:23.550
And you can see we have shopping cart up and the stable up in that they were body also open one of these

01:24.000 --> 01:28.260
opened the TV you can see we have a class called and remove.

01:28.450 --> 01:38.270
It's them to either target dog class list that contains what are going to pass that class remop.

01:38.290 --> 01:41.130
So then what are going to be in this position.

01:41.180 --> 01:47.680
Remember we're seeing you come to the final starting point and then you're going to use the functions

01:48.220 --> 01:52.060
to reach the point that you're trying to achieve.

01:52.060 --> 01:57.150
In this case we're going to be here about an element is going to take us right here.

01:57.550 --> 02:00.370
So what going on is another element.

02:00.370 --> 02:09.850
So we need to in elements right here either to get that element by element that the remote is going

02:09.850 --> 02:18.250
to remove their cars from the room so you can see at the moment the car is empty set this into the cat.

02:18.420 --> 02:24.620
Scroll to the top click here and you can see that the car is gone from the shopping cart.

02:24.940 --> 02:26.830
So this is working nice.

02:26.830 --> 02:33.440
Another thing that we can make it really fast is for example react to these clear car boot on.

02:33.490 --> 02:40.390
So what are going to the filing that butan are going to open these are two top three after the stable

02:40.390 --> 02:41.840
body and a comma.

02:42.070 --> 02:43.670
What I'm going to call this one clear.

02:43.700 --> 02:44.540
Got it.

02:44.690 --> 02:45.100
Yes.

02:45.170 --> 02:49.160
It's going to be quest to document that selector.

02:49.540 --> 02:57.440
And if you take a look here on these two men this one is called Cleator caught in Dady selector will

02:57.450 --> 03:01.800
require that upon sign live God and we need to.

03:02.300 --> 03:10.830
Also the listener clear guard between whether or not the.

03:11.310 --> 03:17.310
It's going to be either listen it out so it's going to be a click and this is going to be clear.

03:17.550 --> 03:18.750
They got it.

03:19.110 --> 03:20.850
So we need to write this one Sean.

03:20.940 --> 03:26.700
Scroll to the bottom and we're going for the fun show on it.

03:26.930 --> 03:30.830
And we're going to also have some comments.

03:31.260 --> 03:37.920
We're going to use the shopping cart and there are two ways to clean it.

03:37.920 --> 03:38.510
Got it.

03:38.660 --> 03:43.440
I'm going to show you boat you can see consider whether we have the shopping cart or content.

03:43.630 --> 03:46.970
And you say stable body so we can select.

03:47.790 --> 03:49.060
Page right here.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.910
We got something like shopping cart.

03:50.920 --> 03:56.990
If there is demand and then pass the THERE.

03:57.010 --> 03:58.210
THEY them empty.

03:58.210 --> 04:04.900
So this is going to insert this in-system LMT is going to take all day to amend that is that it is going

04:04.900 --> 04:13.620
to overwrite the estimate inside a table body weight and this thing that is empty so let's add these

04:13.680 --> 04:15.840
three courses you can see we have three.

04:15.840 --> 04:19.860
And you can click it are not clear cut is going to remove everything.

04:20.250 --> 04:21.560
So let's review this socket.

04:21.570 --> 04:31.360
The second method does one use only their recommended way when I come these nine and this will require

04:31.590 --> 04:33.060
an extra cost.

04:33.460 --> 04:35.830
But is the recommended way of doing it.

04:35.980 --> 04:41.820
Why we're going to have a while then we're going out shopping cart content and then going not fierce.

04:41.870 --> 04:44.770
And while there is a fair trial.

04:44.870 --> 04:48.600
We're going out shopping cart content and then remove child.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.670
So we need to pass this on of this which is going to be shopping cart content for your child.

04:55.960 --> 04:57.100
So this is going to play in.

04:57.110 --> 05:01.810
Also they got it so you can see at the moment the cart is empty.

05:01.810 --> 05:04.270
So let's up these courses again.

05:04.300 --> 05:09.310
You can see that we have like this car and you can see that everything is gone.

05:09.520 --> 05:15.450
This option requires extra growth but is more recommended than this one.

05:15.730 --> 05:17.920
So this Briac is looking nice.

05:17.980 --> 05:23.060
Now we have the ability to of course is into the shopping cart and remove them.

05:23.420 --> 05:25.340
And so to play the World Cup.

05:25.450 --> 05:31.670
So in the next video let's see if we cannot select selected courses into the local storage.
