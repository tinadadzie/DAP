00:00.480 --> 00:04.950
So that's how we can add these courses into local storage.

00:04.980 --> 00:11.700
We're going to open again the Prayag And right after we set these into this domain you can see can we

00:11.700 --> 00:14.560
have everything all the information is going to be added right here.

00:14.820 --> 00:25.150
So what I'm going to call another function that is called The set up of course into storage something

00:25.400 --> 00:36.270
that so here we're going to have a function that is going to be called safe into storage and we're going

00:36.340 --> 00:40.650
to pass this object right here.

00:40.870 --> 00:44.140
So what can I create this function.

00:44.260 --> 00:47.040
Maybe maybe after we create these when

00:51.590 --> 00:57.840
they courses into their local storage we're going to create a function.

00:58.050 --> 01:04.140
It's going to be code like this and it's going to take a course as a parameter.

01:04.440 --> 01:07.080
So then we're going to create another function.

01:07.080 --> 01:17.510
This one is going to get the contents from the storage so what want I can be the one shown good Garces

01:18.310 --> 01:26.260
from a storage and this one doesn't take any parameters but you are going to do something like this

01:26.270 --> 01:27.780
we're going to create a fortune.

01:27.810 --> 01:30.660
We're going to call these when courses.

01:30.980 --> 01:41.000
The same as we did in the last example where we're going to check if the courses exist and if the key

01:41.150 --> 01:44.370
doesn't exist what are going to create an empty array.

01:46.110 --> 02:00.280
So if something exists on storage then we get the value otherwise create an empty array.

02:00.430 --> 02:03.940
So this is what this function does.

02:04.070 --> 02:11.960
So what of the not enough look at the storage when is when courses in the case that this is equals to

02:11.970 --> 02:16.730
null we're going to add courses as an empty array.

02:17.740 --> 02:24.010
On the other hand we're going to call it courses it's going to be cost Jason that bars and it's going

02:24.010 --> 02:30.180
to be cost to look at the storage not get item.

02:30.440 --> 02:33.320
And this is going to it on the courses.

02:33.320 --> 02:41.280
So again this is going to on the course is Carse's right here in Blues-L of course.

02:41.290 --> 02:46.470
So now we're going to use this function in all the different functions starting from here from there

02:46.490 --> 02:48.310
saving to courses.

02:48.320 --> 02:56.390
We're going to lead courses equals to get the courses from storage like these.

02:56.390 --> 03:03.530
So at this point these courses is going to be an array with empty or with something but it's going to

03:03.530 --> 03:04.240
be energy.

03:04.320 --> 03:16.450
It's going to add the corridors into the array using courses that Booge with fast discourse like these.

03:16.610 --> 03:24.830
And now we're going to have these as an array and remember scenes as storage only saves us things we

03:24.830 --> 03:26.160
need to combat.

03:27.380 --> 03:29.660
Jason into training.

03:29.950 --> 03:33.580
We're going to use look at his watch said them.

03:33.700 --> 03:42.410
Going to be courses coma and then we're going to use Jason datastream deify and we passed the array

03:42.790 --> 03:44.160
of core courses.

03:44.690 --> 03:48.340
So save these create and let's add one of these.

03:48.410 --> 03:53.770
Maybe this one the first one up in the console you can see that there are no errors up in the application.

03:54.260 --> 04:01.230
And then you can see we have courses into the storage and you can see that we have the matching We have

04:01.230 --> 04:03.630
also the title right here.

04:03.650 --> 04:06.190
So the pricing we have the Davey.

04:06.300 --> 04:10.250
So you can see that this is an array but it's actually an object.

04:10.380 --> 04:12.720
So what is saving everything right here.

04:12.720 --> 04:20.880
So using this technique use and that is why you can save a raise you can save a race with objects and

04:20.940 --> 04:21.740
others.

04:22.420 --> 04:26.680
But now you can see that everything is in a store is storage.

04:26.900 --> 04:32.270
Remove these reload and I can see that we have of discontent right here.

04:32.590 --> 04:40.840
So in the next day is that when we open these for the very first time we're going to see the elements

04:40.840 --> 04:42.240
in the shopping cart.

04:42.300 --> 04:44.370
So let's continue working in the next video.
