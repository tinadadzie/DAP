00:00.420 --> 00:06.570
So before we continue working with this storage we're going to print their contents from the storage

00:07.020 --> 00:14.730
in the shopping cart when the page is loaded so is going on up and the breaks go to the top and Racheal

00:14.730 --> 00:18.310
we're going I create their document ready.

00:18.420 --> 00:27.150
So it's going to be a document that at the very least an hour and even this can't be done and loaded.

00:27.490 --> 00:36.770
And then we create a thing where the comma we're going to laugh which we call get from local storage.

00:36.980 --> 00:38.390
So get thrown look at the story.

00:38.400 --> 00:48.360
She's going to be a new functions are going to scroll to the bottom loads when the woman is ready and

00:48.360 --> 00:51.570
present the courses into shopping.

00:52.080 --> 00:58.190
So we create a foundation that we're going to get from local storage.

00:58.500 --> 01:03.650
So here's what I call this function they get from I get Garces from the storage.

01:03.660 --> 01:05.380
It's a really similar function.

01:05.760 --> 01:08.730
But the other one will read the this from the storage.

01:09.090 --> 01:12.640
And this one is going to bring the contents up courses.

01:13.040 --> 01:20.420
And then I call these 1 courses and let's see they are courses from the local starch and then we're

01:20.430 --> 01:30.850
going to look through the courses and through and into the got like these what are crap courses.

01:31.010 --> 01:40.470
Less core courses it's there for each function and we're going to bring in each course.

01:40.580 --> 01:46.790
So it's going to be course like this knowing what we're going to create that they will grow.

01:47.460 --> 01:53.790
So again to remember that we have the table boy if we scroll to the top they got content shopping cart

01:53.790 --> 02:00.240
content is pointing to this table body scroll to the bottom.

02:00.410 --> 02:07.680
We're going to create a constant that is going to be a rogue document that creates Elliman they will

02:07.690 --> 02:12.100
roll IDs and then what are going to bring their content.

02:13.590 --> 02:19.530
Morgan I called these windrow and we're going to use again in their Istomin equals to them plate or

02:19.560 --> 02:26.530
string literals and it's going to be very similar to the color code that we already have great.

02:26.540 --> 02:36.130
And this one going to companies and based really really similar actually is the same because we have

02:36.130 --> 02:41.640
the cores we can imagine that died on the price and everything is going to be the same.

02:41.650 --> 02:46.000
So before we close there reach we need to bring this into this shopping cart.

02:46.270 --> 02:54.970
So what event our shopping cart content that I've been trying and we're going to insert the role.

02:55.630 --> 03:00.120
So say these open the console you can see that we don't have any errors.

03:00.160 --> 03:06.760
And when the page loads for the first time when I see they take calls from the local Tarrasch.
