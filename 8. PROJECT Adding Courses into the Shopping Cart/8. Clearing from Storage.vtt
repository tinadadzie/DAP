00:00.460 --> 00:08.750
So something that we can make here is for example the clear cut definition chirality to clear for from

00:08.750 --> 00:09.560
localised storage.

00:09.560 --> 00:16.850
Also So this is going to run this clear cut a function and right after we're going to have the method

00:17.760 --> 00:28.550
clear from localised touch we're going to call these local storage.

00:28.620 --> 00:35.580
This is going to execute this quarter and we're going to create a function clears the one local storage

00:36.420 --> 00:40.770
function little local storage.

00:40.780 --> 00:49.260
This is going to run local storage that the snow is going to be like this up in the application and

00:49.270 --> 00:54.100
you can see that we have courses right here you don't need a car and you can see that everything is

00:54.100 --> 00:54.680
gone.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.110
Oh this is looking nice.

00:56.110 --> 01:02.020
In the next video we're going to see how we can add something here and we can remove these from the

01:02.020 --> 01:02.930
local store.

01:02.980 --> 01:09.500
You can see when I remove these and the Ferlo the course is going to be also in the storage.

01:09.610 --> 01:15.540
So we need to grade a function that is going to remove these from the storage.
