00:00.210 --> 00:01.240
So let's go write the.

00:01.260 --> 00:07.610
That is going to remove the courses from the local storage if you're up in the project.

00:07.620 --> 00:12.360
You can see for example that we have these remove course Farjeon.

00:12.390 --> 00:20.950
This one is going to remove the contents from the shopping cart or from the remove from the dorm.

00:21.130 --> 00:27.610
We need to create a function that is going to remove from the local storage and here.

00:27.730 --> 00:35.680
We're going to create barabar are two different Marable's scores and scores really like these because

00:35.680 --> 00:41.100
we need to access the ivy and you can see that here we have an ivy.

00:41.350 --> 00:47.650
So it's going to be easier to remove something using a navy instead of looking for the title in the

00:47.650 --> 00:54.170
last chapter we build a project where you can see the functionality to remove this from the title.

00:54.430 --> 00:59.770
But in this case I'm going to use this havey so fierce I'm going to cancel the lot.

00:59.790 --> 01:01.960
Those variables cancel that course.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.790
Fears.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.120
And we're going to end right here where we remove the elements.

01:08.240 --> 01:12.340
We're going to of course is going to be cuts to either.

01:12.760 --> 01:16.190
Remember each target is going to read these.

01:16.240 --> 01:18.040
And that is removing everything.

01:18.370 --> 01:28.570
So why not use traversing that element by element is going to restore the cores that Westra more so

01:28.570 --> 01:29.990
that bad is going to be there.

01:30.350 --> 01:32.870
And we're going to send these to the consumer.

01:33.020 --> 01:40.810
So really click here up open the console and you can see we have this table row and these contains all

01:40.810 --> 01:45.340
the data that was hit on the on the shopping cart.

01:45.610 --> 01:51.820
So with this information you can see if I open these we have that data and that Id we're going to remove

01:51.820 --> 01:58.990
these in that ID and we have this information into the cause we're going to use cars these are going

01:58.990 --> 02:04.660
to be close to cars and then select or whatever equity they incurred.

02:04.880 --> 02:12.430
And from that we're going to get attribute we're going to pass that ID.

02:12.570 --> 02:16.710
This is going to be added into the cars and we're going to send this into the console.

02:17.040 --> 02:20.230
So and these and I you can see we have number one.

02:20.430 --> 02:29.910
So we're going to see in that play the Disney function remote of course look at storage going up as

02:29.910 --> 02:37.170
of course the so we need to create create dysfunction and remove cars from local storage I'm going to

02:37.180 --> 02:39.590
add these great here.

02:40.610 --> 02:44.530
Fun show on dream of on a stopwatch.

02:44.620 --> 02:53.800
It's going to take an avi so race you not going out from look at a storage and race here and and again

02:53.800 --> 03:02.170
we're going to call the function this one get courses from localised touch these days right here.

03:03.800 --> 03:19.160
Get there and look at the storage data and then get it going to loop through the array and find the

03:19.170 --> 03:23.540
index to remove.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.300
So it's going to be like this.

03:25.300 --> 03:36.670
Garces is for each function and we can pass for example the cars local storage and remember that we're

03:36.700 --> 03:44.430
going to use splice So we are going to need the index then going up.

03:44.450 --> 03:50.030
Yves and these one should be close in shrubby right here.

03:51.890 --> 03:53.010
The for statement.

03:53.170 --> 03:58.650
So we're going to leave the course of course it is.

03:58.650 --> 04:00.640
So we're checking these.

04:00.870 --> 04:06.420
And if take a look for an application you can see that this is an object so we need to access these

04:06.450 --> 04:19.680
ID so we're going to be cursus unless an adult ID is equal to the size that we're passing and we get

04:19.680 --> 04:21.280
from these codes.

04:22.330 --> 04:27.310
In case this is true we're going to have courses.

04:27.330 --> 04:30.550
There were three courses local storage.

04:30.740 --> 04:37.140
And you can see that here we have the name in singular We have the name in plural.

04:37.540 --> 04:44.230
This name comes from this function and we're going to have to splice splice.

04:44.650 --> 04:51.750
Then we pass the index and we want to remove only one item so save this.

04:51.990 --> 04:59.400
And this is going to take away from this stretch but I'm going to bring that array into the consulate

05:00.200 --> 05:01.080
courses.

05:01.190 --> 05:04.010
Ellis should be in plural.

05:05.350 --> 05:07.210
So save these.

05:07.720 --> 05:10.040
Open the console and open the shopping cart.

05:10.330 --> 05:12.900
Click here and you can see that.

05:12.910 --> 05:21.130
Now we have a named theory so let's add for example another one let's add two more courses.

05:21.140 --> 05:23.710
We're going to have those all around when I click here.

05:23.960 --> 05:30.890
You can see we have two angle here and we're going to happen on you Gwen.

05:30.940 --> 05:32.310
So this is working fine.

05:32.320 --> 05:38.370
So from here we're going to have the rest of the array.

05:38.790 --> 05:49.170
Now we can take away this item we need to add this into the storage set item courses in blowdown and

05:49.170 --> 05:57.230
then J-Zone dot estranging fi and we're going to pass the courses.

05:57.500 --> 06:05.830
You look at the storage which is the complete array so these you can see that we have three different

06:05.830 --> 06:13.590
items so let's remove these and these and reload and you can see that the card is empty because I added

06:13.630 --> 06:15.470
the same course twice.

06:15.490 --> 06:20.020
So in one of these these these.

06:20.070 --> 06:22.570
So now you can see we have three different courses.

06:22.600 --> 06:26.500
Reload these and you can continue the same three courses.

06:26.840 --> 06:34.930
Of these when one cooking course reload these and you can see that we continue having these two courses.

06:35.000 --> 06:41.140
So remove these when reload you can you can see that this is working fine.

06:41.150 --> 06:42.920
So finally you don't get caught.

06:43.070 --> 06:46.990
And this is going to remove everything from the shopping cart.

06:47.210 --> 06:50.540
So now you can see that this was a more complex example.

06:51.440 --> 06:58.150
But I think that you got to be very proud of this work that we have made into this break.

06:58.520 --> 07:05.640
So in the next week let's see another break that is going to contain more than miscreated.

07:05.720 --> 07:07.990
And let's look at a stretch.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.860
So let's continue working in the next video.
